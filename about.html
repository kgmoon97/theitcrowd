      <p>The IT Crowd is a British sitcom originally broadcast by Channel 4,
      written by Graham Linehan, produced by Ash Atalla
      and starring Chris O'Dowd, Richard Ayoade, Katherine Parkinson, and Matt Berry.</p>

      <p>Set in the offices of the fictional Reynholm Industries in London,
      the programme revolves around the three staff members of its IT (information technology) department:
      computer programmer <strong><u>Maurice Moss</u> (Richard Ayoade)</strong>,
      work-shy <strong><u>Roy Trenneman</u> (Chris O'Dowd)</strong>,
      and <strong><u>Jen Barber</u> (Katherine Parkinson)</strong>,
      the department head/relationship manager who knows nothing about IT.
      The programme also focuses on the bosses of Reynholm Industries:
      Denholm Reynholm (Chris Morris) and later, his son Douglas (Matt Berry).
      Goth IT technician Richmond Avenal (Noel Fielding),
      who resides in the dark server room, also features in a number of episodes.</p>
